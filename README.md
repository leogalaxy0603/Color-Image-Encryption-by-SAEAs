This repository contains the official implementation of our paper "A Novel Color Image Encryption Method based on Hierarchical Surrogate-assisted Optimization".
Our method leverages evolutionary computing to intelligently optimize chaotic system parameters and DNA coding operations, achieving superior encryption security through a surrogate-assisted optimization framework that balances cryptographic strength with computational efficiency.
After the paper Accept we will open score the whole code
